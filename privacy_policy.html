        <h1>Privacy Policy for Brainwave Sync (PWA)</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: September 23, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Brainwave Sync (PWA) ("the App") operates regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe and transparent experience.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We DO NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>Brainwave Sync (PWA) is designed to be a privacy-first application. We want to be absolutely clear:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect any personal data from you, such as your name, email address, location, IP address, or any other identifying information.</li>
            <li>We do not track your usage of the App.</li>
            <li>We do not send any data to external servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Local Data Storage (Your Device Only)</h2>
        <p>The App allows you to save your custom brainwave synchronization presets and settings. This data is stored exclusively on your local device, within your web browser's local storage mechanisms (e.g., LocalStorage, IndexedDB). This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your presets and settings never leave your device.</li>
            <li>They are not accessible by us or any third parties.</li>
            <li>You have full control over this data and can delete it by clearing your browser's site data for Brainwave Sync (PWA).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Audio Generation and Export</h2>
        <p>The brainwave synchronization audio is generated in real-time directly within your browser. When you choose to export a WAV file, this process also occurs entirely on your device, and the resulting file is saved directly to your device's downloads. No audio data or generated files are ever sent to our servers.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Brainwave Sync (PWA) does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or other services that would collect data from you.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. As we do not collect any personal data, this policy extends to all users regardless of age.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
